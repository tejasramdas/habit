1. GLMakie needs to be imported twice. Fails to load first time. SOLVED: Load Spinnaker at the end.
2. USB 3 port don't seem to work as USB 2.
3. Memory overload when trying to stream camera using Makie observable.
4. Updated Spinnaker package has not been installed (release is still misspelled).
5. Need to get continuous camera mode working.
6. Save image function keeps hanging. Sometimes get image also hangs.
7. Camera frame rate capped at 10 Hz, probably because of power.
