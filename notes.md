## Anchoring protocol
1. Pipette 2 ml into 24 well plate.
2. Fish for a bunch of Stentor, preferably from the bottom, with 1 ml pipette into 2 ml (to clean). 
3. Repeat twice if necessary.
4. Add 300 ul to dish.
5. Remove 150 ul to create shallow pool (better for imaging).
6. Add Stentor to dish from well with 20 ul pipette. Expel water as necessary to get more cells in a single shot (they will swim up to the top).
7. Wait ~20 minutes to an hour for them to anchor.
